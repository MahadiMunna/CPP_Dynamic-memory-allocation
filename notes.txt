int x; -> here x taking 4 byte in memory.

There are two types of memory
1. stack memory(compile time memory)->Error during compilation like forget to semiclone.
2. Heap memory(runtime memory)->10/0 is a runtime error.

Stack problems:
-after declare memory increase not possible.
-after returning value it clears memory and further that variable will be unusable.

    int *a=new int[5];
this create memory location in heap memory before compile that means direct in the heap memory not in stack memory.
